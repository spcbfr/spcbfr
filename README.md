I maintain [a blog](https://yusuf.fyi), or try to anyways..

I am most productive when coding in laravel

I curate my Development Environment tools carefully. long live Vim!

aside from coding, i'd say 80s British Sitcoms and Science Fiction series are my go to "thing". go watch [_Blackadder_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackadder) if you haven't already.
